# Problem: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Algorithm negotiation fail

## Description

When attempting to establish a connection with an SFTP server using the JSch library, the exception "com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Algorithm negotiation fail" may occur. This indicates issues with the negotiation of encryption and authentication algorithms.

## Possible Cause

It is suspected that the algorithm of the recipient server may be outdated or not compatible with the algorithms supported by JSch.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Establish a connection to an SFTP server using JSch.
2. Observe the exception "com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Algorithm negotiation fail."

## Proposed Solution

Update the algorithm of the recipient server to a newer version that is compatible with the algorithms supported by JSch.

## Additional Information

- JSch Version: [0.1.55](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.jcraft/jsch/0.1.55)

## Note

It is recommended to consult the documentation of the SFTP server to ensure that the supported algorithms on the server are up to date.
